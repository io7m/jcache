 * The type of mutable borrowing least-used caches.

 * <p>
 * A borrowing cache operates as a normal {@link LUCacheType} except that
 * requested keys are marked as <i>borrowed</i> until they are explicitly
 * returned. Attempting to request a key multiple times results in multiple
 * values being loaded by the cache so that each requester receives a fresh
 * copy of the associated value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because keys and values must be explicitly returned to the cache, a
 * {@link BLUCacheType} is not interchangeable with a {@link LUCacheType} and
 * therefore is not type-compatible.
